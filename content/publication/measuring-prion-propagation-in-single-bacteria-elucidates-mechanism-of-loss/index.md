abstract: Prions are self-propagating protein aggregates formed by specific
  proteins that can adopt alternative folds. Prions were discovered as the cause
  of the fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in mammals, but prions
  can also constitute non-toxic protein-based elements of inheritance in fungi
  and other species. Prion propagation has recently been shown to occur in
  bacteria for more than a hundred cell divisions, yet a fraction of cells in
  these lineages lost the prion through an unknown mechanism. Here, we
  investigate prion propagation in single bacterial cells as they divide using
  microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. We show that the propagation occurs
  in two distinct modes. In a fraction of the population, cells had multiple
  small visible aggregates and lost the prion through random partitioning of
  aggregates to one of the two daughter cells at division. In the other
  subpopulation, cells had a stable large aggregate localized to the pole and
  divided asymmetrically, generating a cell with a large aggregate and another
  cell containing small aggregates. Extending our findings to prion domains from
  two orthologous proteins, we observe similar propagation and loss properties.
  Our findings also provide support for the suggestion that bacterial prions can
  form more than one self-propagating state. We implement a stochastic version
  of the molecular model of prion propagation from yeast and mammals that
  recapitulates all the observed single-cell properties. This model highlights
  challenges for prion propagation that are unique to prokaryotes and
  illustrates the conservation of fundamental characteristics of prion
  propagation.

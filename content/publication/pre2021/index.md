abstract: Inferring functional relationships within complex networks from static
  snapshots of a subset of variables is a ubiquitous problem in science. For
  example, a key challenge of systems biology is to translate cellular
  heterogeneity data obtained from single-cell sequencing or flow-cytometry
  experiments into regulatory dynamics. We show how static population snapshots
  of covariability can be exploited to rigorously infer properties of gene
  expression dynamics when gene expression reporters probe their upstream
  dynamics on separate timescales. This can be experimentally exploited in
  dual-reporter experiments with fluorescent proteins of unequal maturation
  times, thus turning an experimental bug into an analysis feature. We derive
  correlation conditions that detect the presence of closed-loop feedback
  regulation in gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, we show how genes with
  cell-cycle-dependent transcription rates can be identified from the
  variability of coregulated fluorescent proteins. Similar correlation
  constraints might prove useful in other areas of science in which static
  correlation snapshots are used to infer causal connections between dynamically
  interacting components

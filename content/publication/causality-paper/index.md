abstract: Characterizing and manipulating cellular behaviour requires a
  mechanistic understanding of the causal interactions between cellular
  components. We present an approach that can detect causal interactions between
  genes without the need to perturb the physiological state of cells. This
  approach exploits naturally occurring cell-to-cell variability which is
  experimentally accessible from static population snapshots of genetically
  identical cells without the need to follow cells over time. Our main
  contribution is a simple mathematical relation that constrains the propagation
  of gene expression noise through biochemical reaction networks. This relation
  allows us to rigorously interpret fluctuation data even when only a small part
  of a complex gene regulatory process can be observed. This relation can be
  exploited to detect causal interactions by synthetically engineering a passive
  reporter of gene expression, akin to the established ``dual reporter assay".
  While the focus of our contribution is theoretical, we also present an
  experimental proof-of-principle to illustrate the approach. Our data from
  synthetic gene regulatory networks in E. coli are not unequivocal but suggest
  that the method could prove useful in practice to identify causal interactions
  between genes from non-genetic cell-to-cell variability.

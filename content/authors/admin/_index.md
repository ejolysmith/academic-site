A theoretical physicist with a habit of doing experiments in biology. 

Theory contributions include deriving fundamental constraints on entire classes of stochastic processes that model biochemical reaction networks in cells. This approach circumvents the major problem that biochemical networks are complex and sparsely characterized, making single models oversimplified or based on untested assumptions. My constraints on classes of dual reporter systems promise to detect causal and dynamic properties of gene regulatory networks from static gene expression data. 

Performed extensive numerical simulations to put these theories to the test, and going one step further: transitioning to the alluring world of experimental biology. Trained in cloning synthetic gene circuits in bacteria, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, using microfluidic devices, and applying machine learning algorithms for cell segmentation. By engineering a number of variants of the celebrated [Repressilator](https://www.nature.com/articles/35002125) gene circuit, I demonstrated the utility of my theoretical constraints. 

Obtained a BSc. in [Honours Physics and Mathematics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2023-2024/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-honours-mathematics-and-physics) from McGill University in 2017, and a MSc. in Physics from the University of Toronto in 2019. Currently in the final stage of the Physics PhD program at the University of Toronto.

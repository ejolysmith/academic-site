Graduated from McGill University in Honours Physics and Mathematics. Joined the U of T Physics Graduate Program in 2018. 

A key aim of systems biology is to characterize gene regulatory networks in cells. This is a monumental challenge, as high throughput methods like single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry generate static population snapshots (making dynamic inference difficult), perturbation experiments often affect many components at once (making causal inference difficult), and lastly, these networks are sparsely characterized (making mathematical modelling difficult). My research focuses on exploiting fluctuations in gene expression to infer causal and dynamic properties of gene regulatory networks from static snapshots of cell-to-cell variability.

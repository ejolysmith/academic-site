Here is a zoom talk recording for the 2022 APS March Meeting for those that could not make the in person event. {{< youtube GqaatCWVmRM >}} I have repeated the experiment shown in the video with 6 other fluorescent proteins with varying maturation delays to optimize the method.  I have also measured the maturation times of these proteins using our microfluidic setup anagolously to the method shown [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4509).The data is being analyzed. I hope to share the results with you very soon!
